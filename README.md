# distributAr

**distribut**ed**Ar**chitecture is a Tiny distributed computation framework for spiking ANNs and more!
distributAr's primary purpose is to distribute Spiking Artificial Neural Networks among multiple hosts or CPUs.  It provides mechanisms for sharing spike times among running threads. Threads running in a single process communicate through shared memory. Threads running in differrent processes or on different machines communicate via network multicast. 

What sets distributar apart from other frameworks is that all machines (spike time clocks on all machines) are synchronized in time without affecting the hardware clock of individual machines.

Control plane is implemented with a simple text protocol.  You create a plugin dll to do whatever you want implementing ICluster interface and distributAr runs it in a single thread.  You can have as many threads as you want doing processing and as many instances of the server as you want. For now there is one tracker and one time server (should become redundant).  Connectivity among clusters is user defined. You can create a graph file and upload it into distributAr or connect clusters individually.

My speculation is that algorithms required to build an Intelligent system using ANNs would describe (A) how an individual neuron operates (detection/threshold and internal state change mechanism) (B) how neurons interconnect into groups such as cortical columns (C) how these groups are connected to each other, which might be a genetic algorithm responsible for reflexes.  distributAr operates on level (C) without creating constraints on levels A and B.  To avoid Combinatorial explosion distributAr creates subnets (clusters of neurons) with a small number of nodes. (Partition the network.)  It lets you connect some nodes in this subnet to N other subnets (not nodes in other subnets directly).  Your responsibility is to let each of those subnets (clusters) figure out the connectivity of input nodes to it's internal nodes.

### The project has a few unusual goals
1) keep the code base small!!! Currently its a bit over 2000 lines of code.
2) reduce dependency on external libraries

If you want to bloat the project with your bright ideas, please fork.  
If you want to run on windows/mac, put/move all OS dependent code into lib/  
This project requires only a C++11 compliant compiler.  

### Building distributAr

doing git clone, changing to main dir and typing "make" compiles 6 executable and one library:

**libdummy.so.1**  - a dummy ANN (cluster of neurons) that sends and receives some random data  
**nets** - main server.  Loads libdummy.so.1  then connects to tracker and waits for client commands  
**nett** - tracker.  Each server thread registers with the tracker and gets a "cluster id". Client gets info from tracker.  
**netw** - time server facilitates synchronization of time among server instances  
**netc** - client to send commands to tracker and server instances  
**netg** - Not required to run distributAr. Creates random network configurations for testing by creating a random graph and saving it to a DOT file.  
Think of this graph as the DNA that defines peripheral nervous system connectivity and connectivity among regions of the brain in living systems.  
**neto** - Not required to run distributAr.  Partitions a graph file (*.dot) to run on N clusters and optimizes the cluster CPU affinity to reduce the number of hyperedges between the clusters.  Node labels in the output file specify the groups.

### Project parts
Client: builds network according to the graph or allows issuing commands to tracker/server/IoServer  
Tracker: keeps track of cluster ID to IP:port mappings.  As clusters come up, they get IDs from the tracker by registering.  
Server: houses clusters of neurons each running on its own thread.  server can load any DLL implementing ICluster interface.  
Time Server: synchronizes time among running processes. lib/timesync.* is the client  
Network class - provides multicast read connectivity to subscribe/read from clusters running on other computers  
TimeBuff class - data structure for placing impulses into network packets  
udp.*    - wrapper around UDP protocol  
Graph Generator: genrates a random graph representing a network structure  
serial.h - provides serialization primitives  

Some real time Spiking ANN simulations such as sound localization using interaural time difference (ITD) might require a high resolution clock.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaural_time_difference   reports: "The normal human threshold for detection of an ITD is up to a time difference of 10Î¼s (microseconds)".  It is something to be aware of since it is an indication of the time precision required to simulate biological neural networks in real time.

My framework does not provide sufficient clock synchronization (microseconds) since I currently perform time synchronization in software.  If I perform all Input / Output (IO) through a single processor, and modify the framework a bit, I do not have to synchronize the clocks at all since spikes will travel through the rest of ANN as timestamps from the processor doing the IO.  I can also fix it by using hardware based Precision Time Protocol (PTP) which allows for clock synchronization down to nano seconds over 100Mbit Ethernet.
